      <p>You have one of the greatest assets your company can leverage right now! You are a living, thinking breathing person with individual tastes and a unique perspective. There will never be another you and that has value. Lend yourself to your business - it will pay dividends.</p>

<h3>Be a Real Person</h3>

<p>REWORK said it best, "Marketing is not a department." What that means is your business is not a fancy website. Your business is not expensive advertising. Your business isn't even your product. Your business is you!</p>

<p>As Starters, we have a competitive advantage against bigger players. Unlike the big boys, our customers actually get to know us and that creates shared bonds the big boys could only dream of building.</p>

<p>You have to come from out of the covers and leave the safety of anonymity to truly build a lasting relationship with your people. The kinship between you and your customer has a 1:1 correlation with the value your product provides.</p>

<p>I'm not saying you can be the <em>life of the party</em> and sell crappy products. No. What I am saying is you can't sell great products and be a crappy business owner - that my friend simply won't do.</p>

<h3>Start Small and Stay Small</h3>

<p>Start small and stay small. Email a customer right now - just to say Hi and thank him for his business. Sometimes I just pick a customer and send them a salutation letting them know how much I value their business and to inquire about their interest (non-business or business related).</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be a big deal. But, it can be a big deal to the bottom line. Advertisement and promotions are transient at best. So be a real person and invite people to you. When in doubt place a premium on relationships.</p>

<h3>Even the Big Boys Are Starting to Get the Picture</h3>

<p>Make no mistake, one of your biggest assets is being a real person. Even the big boys are starting to get the picture. Case in point - <a href="http://www.effie.org/winners/showcase/2011/5367">The MINI vs Porsche Challenge</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://techoctave.com/c7/static/mini-vs-porche-1.jpg" width="520" alt="The Mighty MINI COOPER vs Fancy Pants Porsche 911"/></p>

<p>THE MIGHTY MINI COOPER VS FANCY PANTS PORSCHE 911</p>

<p>Here, MINI attempts to do with millions in advertising what you can do naturally and effortlessly. The idea is a small (very small) car could challenge the legendary sports prowess of the Porsche.</p>

<p>Logically, it isn't very realistic for MINI to challenge Porsche, but you've gotta love the angles here. The underdog versus the powerhouse. David versus Goliath.</p>

<p>They even got the President of MINI USA in on the act:</p>

<p>THE PITCH</p>

<p>Using its President, MINI really tries to get you to identify and bond with a real human being. They know what we know intrinsically - people buy from people they like. Not fancy advertisements and not fancy marketing. I think he does a great job - I like him!</p>

<h3>Marketing Still Matters</h3>

<p>Marketing still matters. You can't forget that. You can't ever forget that. No one can buy a product that they don't know exists - it's humanly impossible.</p>

<p>So bring value to the market and do your lovely print and web advertisements. Just know that those advertisements are supplements and can never be the main course.</p>

<p>Still, do make your marketing materials both beautiful and memorable. Just like the MINI Team did here:</p>

<p><img src="http://techoctave.com/c7/static/mini-vs-porche-2.png" width="520" alt="
WE WENT. WE RACED. WE ALMOST BEAT FRICKIN' PORSCHE!"/></p>

<p>WE WENT. WE RACED. WE ALMOST BEAT FRICKIN' PORSCHE!</p>

<p>How awesome is that? What mega corporation do you know that uses the word "frickin". Exactly! The lesson here is about being personable and endearing.</p>

<p>The only way I know how to do that is simply to be me. And that's what you need to do too. You need to dig deep and simply be you.</p>

<p>Here's another beautiful and memorable piece by the MINI Team:</p>

<h3>Get in The Ring</h3>

<p>If you're starting out, embrace that fact. It is the fabric - indeed it is the DNA - of your company. It doesn't have to be a big pageant about who's the most interesting. But it has to be about you and it has to be real. This is the source of your strength as a Starter.</p>

<p>Be the DNA you want your company to have. Embrace being real. Embrace your customers. You can do this better than the big boys. Nurture this fact. Live this fact!</p>

<p>Start with being a real person.</p>
