<p>I don't use <a href="https://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>. I find the UI brings very little excitement. And the UX (ugh)...Unread post counts make me feel like I have chores to complete, a never ending todo list. I have a large enough todo list already - believe me.</p>

<p>Last week, Google announced it will <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">shut down Google Reader</a> on July 1, 2013. Some would say <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/good-riddance-google-reader/">good riddance</a> - I wouldn't go so far. Reader wasn't the best of applications, but it did provide some value. Reader didn't end world hunger, but I'd argue it did change the world.</p>

<p>Whether we admit it, or not, Reader introduced people to RSS and open data and open standards that, but for, they would not have been privy to. That's a big deal.</p>

<p>When a grandfather in the middle of Missouri can subscribe to his grandson's travel blog in Madrid. That's a big deal.</p>

<p>When there are over 500,000 people who never have to ask, "How do I subscribe to your blog?" That's a big deal.</p>

<p>But this is not about Google Reader.</p>

<h3>This is about the State of the Open Web</h3>

<p>Platforms with user generated content are becoming increasingly closed. This concerns me. <a href="http://www.staynalive.com/2011/05/twitter-and-facebook-both-quietly-kill.html?q=1">Twitter and Facebook both quietly killed RSS</a>; Opting for a proprietary API over an open standard in its place.</p>

<p>Believe me, it's not just RSS either. In the same move to dispatch Reader, <a href="http://www.muktware.com/5387/google-kills-caldav-api-support-pushes-its-own-calendar-api">Google also quietly killed CalDAV</a>, an open calendar standard, in favor of it's own proprietary calendar API. What's next? Shut down IMAP for Gmail?</p>

<p>This isn't what the web is supposed to be. Those weren't the type of companies we thought we were helping to build.</p>

<p>Are there better standards? <a href="http://www.json.org/">Maybe</a>. Does it matter? Not very much.</p>

<p>The you create content, we sell your content business model of Twitter and Facebook has long drawn a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">line-in-the-sand</a>. The writing is clear: Use our API or use nothing at all. Our way or the highway. More dictatorship than democracy.</p>

<p>Chillin.</p>

<h3>We should all be concerned</h3>

<p>If the giants of industry, companies we helped build, don't support open standards, then why should your local congressman support open government?</p>

<p>If the future of sharing is measured in ROI, then what will the future of freedom be measured in? Should we have to make a business case for the free flow of people and property as well? Whose property?</p>

<p>Everyday, millions of people ask these very questions and it sickens me. Google Reader's demise is just a painful reminder that freedom of information is slowly losing its God-given place as a foundation of our democracy.</p>

<p>Yet, every rally for open standards, every cry for a more perfect Union is the very deed that keeps evil at bay. What will your deed be?</p>

<p>Because in the final hour, this is not about one company or one product...This is not about Google Reader.</p>

<p>This is about the future.</p>
