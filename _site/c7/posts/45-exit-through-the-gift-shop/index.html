<p>Exit Through the Gift Shop is the story of how an eccentric French shop keeper (Terry Guetta) and amateur film maker attempted to locate and befriend Banksy, only to have the artist turn the camera back on its owner.</p>

<p>This film had me thinking about so many things. What is art? Is there such a thing as art? Is art about the money or the passion? Can one exist without the other?</p>

<p>Even still, what the hell is passion anyway? I, personally, always hated the term Serial Entrepreneur because I want to build a more meaningful and enduring business. To this day, I still hate the term. But so what!?!</p>

<p>That's me, my journey, my legacy and where I want to be. That has nothing to do with you or the next guy. What if your dream is to build 100 small businesses? Then do that! For me, I'll focus on building one really good business and scaling it.</p>

<p>Look at Terry Guetta - by all accounts a mad man! Still, he had a quality about him that Starters can learn from. If he had an interest in something, he just did it! Plain and simple.</p>

<p>This guy didn't know the first thing about film making. So what! He started filming anyway. He didn't know the first thing about street art. Still, a minor inconvenience - he got to work and just did it!</p>

<p>Terry didn't know the first thing about opening an art gallery. Let's do it anyway! Terry, admittedly, had mental health issues, but there is a lot we can learn from him as Starters:</p>

<p>Terry Guetta. Mr. Brainwash. MBW. My hats off to you because I believe you are truly a phenomena. Street Artists made a mockery of the Commercialization of Art. Which means you made a mockery of the mockery of the Commercialization of Art. Brilliant!</p>

<p>Rabbit. Hare. Keyser Soze. Banksy Hoax. No one can be sure. But, one thing is for sure. Street artists every where will remember you for as long as they live. Still, Banksy said it best:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Brainwash is a force of nature,
he's a phenomenon. And I don't mean
that in a good way. -Banksy</p></blockquote>

<p>My hats off to you Sir! Live long and prosper! Shalom aleichem! Or...like whatever!</p>
