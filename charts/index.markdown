## Powerful JavaScript Charts Suite

<strong>Pie Charts:</strong> Pie charts are circular charts subdivided into pie slices. Pie charts are used to illustrate the size relationship between each pie slice and the whole pie. Our charts include the Pie Chart, Donut Chart and Spie Chart:

![piechart](/images/piechart.png)

![donutchart](/images/donutchart.png)

<strong>Bar Charts:</strong> Bar charts show the changes in a data series over time and can be used to compare one or more categories of data. Stacked bar charts compare the value that each data point contributes to a total across categories. For example, a single bar can represent the amount of sales for one product on top of a bar representing sales for another product. Our charts include the Bar Chart and Stacked Bar Chart:

![barchart](/images/barchart.png)

![barstackedchart](/images/barstackedchart.png)


<strong>Column Charts:</strong> Column charts are vertical bar charts. Like bar charts, they can be used to compare one or more categories of data. Stacked column charts compare the value that each data point contributes to a total across categories. Our charts include the Column Chart and Stacked Column Chart:

![columnchart](/images/columnchart.png)

![columnstackedchart](/images/columnstackedchart.png)


<strong>Line Charts:</strong> Line charts display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. Line charts create a simple way to show the changes in value between categories of data. Our charts include the Line Chart and Area Chart:

![linechart](/images/linechart.png)

![areachart](/images/areachart.png)


<strong>Scatter Charts:</strong> Scatter charts are used to show the relationship between two variables. The relationship is displayed as a collection of points using Cartesian coordinates. Our charts include a Scatter Chart:

![scatterchart](/images/scatterchart.png)

Our Scatter charts are fully customizable. Including the ability to consume as many datasets as you need, the ability to apply custom formats to axis values, the ability to connect datapoint dots with lines and even turn off datapoints dots all together.

![scatterchart-linechart](/images/scatterchart-linechart.png)


<strong>Bullet Charts:</strong> Bullet charts feature a primary measure (e.g. revenue) and give you the ability to compare that measure to a target measure. Using color bands, you can relate the primary measure to qualitative ranges of performance (e.g. poor, satisfactory, and good). Our chart can display horizontally and vertically:

In a Radar chart, a point close to the center indicates a low value and a point near the perimeter indicates a high value. Expect only the best from our Radar chart:

## Powerful customization when details count.

<strong>Customers and requirements change.</strong> We needed a charting solution that allowed us to change as well - so we built one:

![highly_customizable_charts](/images/highly_customizable_charts.png)

Our JavaScript charts are highly customizable because every situation is different. Changing times require agile solutions. We believe our JavaScript charts do something no one else can...We put your success in your hands - as it should be.

<br/>


## Cross browser goodness baked in.

<strong>Cross browser and cross platform.</strong> We believe in standards-based development and we believe you can get there without Flash or any other proprietary platform.

That's why we use standards-based SVG, VML and JavaScript. No Flash means longer battery life. No Flash means our gauges are mobile friendly - Think iPad & iPhone. We built a JavaScript gauge library we love to use and you will too.

![browsers](/images/browsers.png)

We've tested on both Windows and Mac OS X in every major browser. Including: IE7 and IE8, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and even Opera. You focus on coding your business logic. We've got you covered in the browser department.

<br/>

## Beautiful and Usable Documentation

<strong>Software that's easy to use.</strong> Software shouldn't be painful to handle. In fact, the information you need to get going should be well organized and easily understood:

![documentation](/images/documentation.png)

We produce quality documentation of how our software works, insuring you spend most of your time enjoying our JavaScript gauges and being most productive on your projects.

<br/>


## Powerful API. Great JavaScript Charts!

<strong>Everything a sophisticated developer needs.</strong> Beautiful object oriented code. You already know JavaScript, so implementation is a breeze. You will find JavaScript and jQuery best practices with an easily extensible Gauge class and smart default options. Check this out:

<p class="code">
	<span>var sales = new LineChart("sales", {</span>
		<span class="content">data: [ [1000, 400], [1170, 460], [660, 1120], [1030, 540] ],</span>
		<span class="content">area: true,</span>
		<span class="content">legendTitle: "Yearly Sales",</span>
		<span class="content">legendLabels: ["Gauges", "Charts"],</span>
		<span class="content">groupLabels: ["2008", "2009", "2010", "2011"],</span>
        <span class="content">lineColors: ["#ff0000", "#2143ff"],</span>
        <span class="content">majorTicks: 7</span>
	<span>});</span>
</p>

<p class="code">
	<span>. . .</span>
</p>

<p class="code">
	<span>&lt;div id=&quot;sales&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</p>

Is it really that easy? Yes it is my friend. Yes it is.

![areachart2](/images/areachart2.png)

Most of the time you'll need to feed data to your gauge from a remote server. Let's say you want to get the latest [JSON data](https://rawgit.com/techoctave/data/master/data.json) from your server:

<p class="code">
	<span>$.getJSON(url, function(response) {</span>
		<span class="content">var units = response.data;</span>
		<span class="content">var revenue = units.revenue;</span>
        <span class="content">var expenses = units.expenses;</span>
        <span class="content">var data = [[revenue],[expenses]];</span>
        <span class="content">sales.setData(data);</span>
	<span>});</span>
</p>

Here, we used jQuery to make an Ajax call for some JSON data. What this means is you can update each gauge without refreshing the page. You'll be able to do this with every gauge in our suite. Think of the possibilities!

<strong>Smart and intuitive API design.</strong> Each purchase includes sample projects with tons of examples on how to use our chart's API. This includes a live example of how to feed data to our charts from a remote server using Ajax.

For an advanced discussion on client-side polling techniques, see [Long Polling with JavaScript and jQuery](https://techoctave.com/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery) on the TechOctave blog. There we discuss various options for feeding data to our charts from a remote server.
