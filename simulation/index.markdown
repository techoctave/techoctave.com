## Cross browser goodness baked in.

<strong>Cross browser and cross platform.</strong> We believe in standards-based development and we believe you can get there without Flash or any other proprietary platform.

That's why we use standards-based SVG, VML and JavaScript. No Flash means longer battery life. No Flash means our gauges are mobile friendly - Think iPad & iPhone. We built a JavaScript gauge library we love to use and you will too.

![browsers](/images/browsers.png)

We've tested on both Windows and Mac OS X in every major browser. Including: IE7 and IE8, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and even Opera. You focus on coding your business logic. We've got you covered in the browser department.

<br/>


## Highly configurable flight gauges.

<strong>Fully exposed API.</strong> Every background, every line, every needle, every frame, everything is at your fingertips to control:

![configurable_flight_gauges](/images/configurable_flight_gauges.png)

For us it's simple, give you the best software. Then get out of the way. We believe our JavaScript components do something no one else can. . .We put your success in your hands - as it should be.

![glasscockpit](/images/glasscockpit.gif)


So go all digital and create your own custom glass cockpits. Or develop a custom multi-functional display. If you can dream it, our flight gauges can help you pull it off and then some.

No matter the requirement or client demand, we keep our flight gauges flexible so you can stay flexible too.


<br/>


## Beautiful and Usable Documentation

<strong>Software that's easy to use.</strong> Software shouldn't be painful to handle. In fact, the information you need to get going should be well organized and easily understood:

![documentation](/images/documentation.png)

We produce quality documentation of how our software works, insuring you spend most of your time enjoying our JavaScript gauges and being most productive on your projects.

<br/>


## So what's under the hood?

<strong>Everything a sophisticated developer needs.</strong> Beautiful object oriented code. You already know JavaScript, so implementation is a breeze. You will find JavaScript, jQuery & Raphael best practices with easily extensible flight gauge classes and smart default options. Check out this Altimeter flight gauge:

<p class="code">
	<span>var altimeter = new Altimeter("altimeter", {</span>
		<span class="content">altitude: 0,</span>
		<span class="content">reporting: 0,</span>
		<span class="content">hundreds: 0,</span>
		<span class="content">thousands: 0</span>
	<span>});</span>
</p>

<p class="code">
	<span>altimeter.setAltitude(0);</span>
	<span>altimeter.setReporting(2573);</span>
	<span>altimeter.setHundreds(2);</span>
	<span>altimeter.setThousands(1);</span>
</p>

<p class="code">
	<span>. . .</span>
</p>

<p class="code">
	<span>&lt;div id=&quot;altimeter&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</p>

Is it really that easy? Yes it is my friend. Yes it is.

Most of the time you'll need to feed data to your flight gauges from a remote server. For an advanced discussion on client-side polling techniques, see [Long Polling with JavaScript and jQuery](https://techoctave.com/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery) on the TechOctave blog. There we discuss various options for feeding data to our components from a remote server.

For real-time server-push solutions, our flight gauges work great with HTML5 WebSockets, so grab your favorite WebSockets library.

<br/>

## So, what's next exactly?

<strong>Purchase a library package.</strong> Within a few seconds, you'll receive a receipt for your purchase and a secure link to download the package. Each package comes with tons of examples to get you up and running in no time.

Or contact us to schedule a demo. We'll walk you through the example projects and answer any questions you may have.
