#We build our software on six core principles

<dl class="principles">
	<dt>Beautifully Illustrated</dt>
	<dd>We start with good design so you can start ahead because we want you to both feel good and look good.</dd>

	<dt>Cross Browser Compatible</dt>
	<dd>No one likes having to fiddle with browser quirk after browser quirk. We make sure you never have to.</dd>

	<dt>Lightweight Footprint</dt>
	<dd>Size does matter when you make good software. We stay lightweight so your application loads at lightning speed.</dd>
	
	<dt>Vector Based for Crisp Zoom and Print</dt>
	<dd>Never worry about pixelation again. Our vector based components are standards based and flexible for both mobile & responsive web solutions.</dd>
	
	<dt>Highly Configurable</dt>
	<dd>Mix and match features to create something truly unique and all your own. Our components are great for executive dashboards, simulations or simply to impress your hard won clientele.</dd>
	
	<dt>Framework Agnostic</dt>
	<dd>We believe our JavaScript components do something no one else can. . .We put your success in your hands - as it should be. Choose your favorite framework or choose no framework at all. It's your solution.</dd>
