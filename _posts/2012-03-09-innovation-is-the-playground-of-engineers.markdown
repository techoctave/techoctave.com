I believe [software engineers should be running software][1] companies. Don't get me wrong, there is room for everyone else as well - even MBAs. Just not at the top spot. Others are starting to catch on as well.

### A Bold Statement Indeed
Today [Reddit named Yishan Wong][2] - a software engineer - as its next Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Reddit is a company that's going places because it just gets it. Shoemakers should be run by shoe guys, and software firms by software guys.

Foresight and empathy in software engineering are skills you simply must master first-hand. You learn each from [hard won experience][3]. It's not going to come in 30 or 21 days. You're not going to learn them in 24 or 12 hours. And it's certainly not going to come learning from Sams or any other Dummy. It takes ten years.

Reddit's move to hire a CEO from the software development ranks was a bold statement indeed. They didn't have to do it. I'm sure it was a difficult decision and I commend them for making the difficult decision.

I can just imagine every fresh-pressed MBA within earshot must've vied for the title. But Reddit applied what the late [Steve Jobs][4] knew so well - innovation is the playground of engineers.

### Congratulations and go get 'em!

Congratulations [Yishan][5] on starting your new job as CEO. Know that you've been practicing - for many years - all the prerequisites needed to run a great software company.

Everything else you can learn and be advised on. That's not easily said in reverse and that's why you'll make a great CEO at Reddit.

Looking forward to seeing where Reddit goes next. Happy coding and go get 'em!
