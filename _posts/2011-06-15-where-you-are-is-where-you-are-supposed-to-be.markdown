Where you are is where you are supposed to be. Think about it for awhile. Think about how powerful a statement that is.

For almost a decade, I've lived my life on a few Core Principles. One of them is to never have any regrets. No matter what!

Believe me - that's easier said than done. Some of my decisions are invariably harder than others. But you'd be surprise to learn that - for me - the harder the decision the easier it is for me to make.

How can that be? Simple. I believe with all my heart that each of us has a purpose in this life. And the simple fact of the matter is that I refuse to squander my purpose or even an inkling of my time. That's how valuable my time is to me.

So, for me, the harder the decision the easier it is to make. Because while I give each decision I make thorough introspection, I give the harder decisions unbelievable amounts of attention. And that's another thing I believe, "The harder things shape our future."

We are a summation of the decisions we make in our lives. Good or bad, "What is your life adding up to?"
