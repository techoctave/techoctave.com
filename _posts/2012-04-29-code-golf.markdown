The only thing better than Chamomile Tea is Chamomile Tea and [Code Golf][1]. Code Golf is a Stack Exchange community for programming puzzle enthusiasts and code golfers.

If you've ever met me in-person, you know I love talking development in general and code in particular. What's interesting about Code Golf is the ability to learn from a global assortment of your peers in a condensed and rather fun period of time.

Let's look at a few code snippets from an example Code Golf: [Reinvent the For loop][2].

###Reinventing the For Loop

The for loop is a fundamental iteration construct in many programming languages:

{% highlight js %}
    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) 
    {
       JustDoIt();
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This Code Golf's author challenges developers to:

*Execute a basic for loop without using any repetition structures (for, foreach, while, do, etc).*

The responses are nothing short of astounding really. There were submission for C, Haskell, x86 Assembly, Python, C#, Java, Ruby, Closure, Scala, LISP, Perl, Groovy, Basic and JavaScript.

I'm a big fan of JavaScript. In fact, I believe [The Future is JavaScript][3]. So let's look at some of the more interesting JavaScript submission in Reinventing the For Loop.

####JavaScript Submissions

Entry #1:

{% highlight js %}
    function f(m,c) {
       m ? c()&f(--m,c) : 0
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Entry #2:

{% highlight js %}
    function f(m,c) {
       m&&c()&f(--m,c)
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This version was inspired by Entry #1.

Entry #3:

{% highlight js %}
    (function i(s,r){
        r += s + ' ';
        s++ < 1e3 ? i(s,r) : console.log(r)
    })(0,'')
{% endhighlight %}

Code Golf is pretty interesting. Hopefully, it gives you a good opportunity to sit back, relax and learn from our peers.

Happy Coding and Enjoy!
