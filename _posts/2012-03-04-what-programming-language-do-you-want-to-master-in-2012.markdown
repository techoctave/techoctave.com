*Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person. - Albert Einstein*

Who amongst us is not a [polyglot programmer][1]? I'm writing a new book and I'd like to know which lanaguage would you master this 2012?

Your typical desktop application might see two to three languages. A .NET developer might use C#, an OSX/iOS developer might use Objective-C or a J2EE developer might use Java. Throw in any inter-application communication and you're either remoting or serving/consuming some Internet Media Type like JSON, XML or SOAP.

And then, of course, there is the matter of persisting the data. Then you might interact with SQL, HQL or some other Domain Specidic Langauge (DSL) for querying data. Building robust web applications become even more interesting.

A full stack web application could see all manner of language or DSL. On the front-end, you necessarily add HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript to your repertoire. Potentially, even Haml or Saas as alternatives to HTML5 and CSS3 markup. Maybe your interested in the latest Designer Languages and have tried CoffeeScript as an alterntive to JavaScript. And that's just the client-end, server-side platforms lend way to even more programming langauges, dialects and DSLs.

.NET shop - are your running classic ASP.NET or have you moved on to ASP.NET MVC? J2EE shop - are you running Struts 2 or have you moved on to JRuby and Rails? Ruby shop - are you running Rails or Sinatra? Even down to your choice of Object Relational Mappers - are you in the Roll-Your-Own camp, or the ActiveRecord camp, or the NHibernate/DataMapper camp?

Who amongst us is not a polyglot programmer? But, which langauge, near or dear, would you master in 2012?

Is it JavaScript? A particular facet of .NET maybe - C# or NHibernate? Ruby maybe? Tell me below. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Happy Coding!
