Listen, I'm not going to sit here and tell you [Tweetlr][1] will cook your breakfast and make your bed.

I'm also not going to tell you it was designed from ancient Inca plans, blessed by the High-Priestess of Macchu Picchu and later excavated from the eternal burial site of Christopher Columbus. That would be a stretch...

What I am going to tell you is Tweetlr was developed by highly trained, ex-CIA, Buddhist Ninjas under deep cover in Columbus, OH. And [At dawn...we ride][2].

###The Twitter Management Tool We Trust

A really good developer once told me, "The only thing guaranteed in life is good beer and bad software." I bought him a Heineken and told him, "Good luck with that." A few months later, I founded TechOctave.

I believed then and I believe now that software should be beautiful and inspired. I've made it my life's work to realize that dream. 

For over a year, Tweetlr has been a part of that dream. Helping my team and I engage and learn from quality folks that we simply wouldn't have had the time to meet but for Tweetlr.

I'm not going to be shy about this - Tweetlr is beautiful. It has a well sculpted interface that people simply love to use. Just as important - Tweetlr is functional. It provides an easy and intuitive way to build the audience that's right for you and your team.

But more importantly, we built [Tweetlr][3] to take the guess work out of complying with Twitter's Terms of Use. We stay up-to-date with Twitter's policies so you don't have to. The software simply won't allow you to violate Twitter's Terms of Use, thereby keeping you safe and secure.

We've weaved together beauty with compliance and a first-class experience that will keep you satisfied and, most importantly, focused on building a more targeted audience and a better business.

We trust Tweetlr everyday to help us do just that. And we're betting that you will too.

###Opinionated Software is Usable Software

I joke about Buddhists and Ninjas and High-Priestesses - You do know I was joking right? But, believe it or not, Tweetlr was inspired by the beauty and rolling enclaves of the real [Machu Picchu][4]:

The idea is we wanted to be immersed in such  a way as to be inspired during the search process. Yet, have the tools and functionality to actually get things done.

Contrast the beautiful rolling hills of Machu Picchu with the everyday utility of actually living there with it's houses, bakeries, foundries and daily life. What you'll find staring back at you is an allegory for how we live our lives. One that doesn't divorce beauty from utility or force existence into neat little cubicles.

Behind that allegory is the fundamental DNA for what grew to become our beloved Twitter management tool. We built Tweetlr on three core principles. We believed Tweetlr should be:

{% highlight ruby %}
 1. Beautiful and Inspired
 
 2. Fast and Responsive
 
 3. Pleasantly Useful
{% endhighlight %}

To that end we created a Twitter management tool that enhances your social media work on Twitter, but does it in style.

###Tweetlr Isn't for Everyone

It takes much thoughtfulness and restraint to decide what goes into software and what does not. To be frank, Tweetlr is defined by what it doesn't do just as much as by what it does.

Tweetlr doesn't post to your timeline. It doesn't read your timeline either. It doesn't touch your direct messages. It doesn't integrate with Facebook or Pinterest or Instagram. It doesn't do a lot of things and we like it that way.

Tweetlr's mission is simply to help you build a better audience. To that end, we've developed a beautiful app that we know you'll love to use.

Just starting out with Twitter - Tweetlr is for you. Managing multiple Twitter accounts for your company and clientele - Tweetlr is for you. Managing thousands of Twitter followers - Tweetlr is for you.

Tired of wasting countless hours just to find a handful of people (if you're lucky) - Tweetlr is for you. Frustrated that you can't find like-minded folks - Tweetlr is for you. Follow Fridays never made any goddamn sense - Tweetlr is (definitely) for you.

Business isn't easy. If it was, everyone would be doing it. You're going to need all the help you can get. I know that and you know that. Give yourself a leg up while expanding your social presence and use a Twitter management tool you can trust from a great team of folks you can believe in.
