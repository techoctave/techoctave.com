I get asked a lot, "What's it like to be a software developer?" Sometimes its easy to answer, but there are days the answer gets a wee bit more interesting. Those days remind me a lot of this clip from [Malcolm in the Middle][1]...

And I get to wondering, "What if Breaking Bad is just Hal having a bad dream?"
