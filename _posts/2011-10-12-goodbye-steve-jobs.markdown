*It appears, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity.* -Nicolo Machiavelli, [The life of Castruccio Castracani of Lucca][1]

[Steve Jobs][2] often reminded me of Castruccio Castracani. Both men were given up at birth. Both rose to epic portions in their field. Both passed entirely too soon.

I listen to fate more than most men. I also love her more than most men. Sometimes I like to think she shows us her presence in men like Castruccio and Steve. Somewhere between obscurity and greatness; during those moments when we can only ask, "How?" That's the moment fate shows her hand.

###The life of Steve Jobs of California

I miss Steve Jobs. I miss his leadership. I miss his relentless focus on products. I miss his thoughtfulness. 

Many have asked, "How can so many people mourn the loss of someone they didn't even know?" I disagree. We knew Steve Jobs intimately.

I sell products. I believe software should be beautiful and inspired. Most importantly, I believe the act of exchanging money for a product or service is one the most intimate acts two people can share.

In that moment, you effectively say, "I believe this product has value to me and I am willing to trade my very hard earned cash for it." That's intimacy. We knew Steve Jobs intimately. We mourn him intimately.

###Goodbye Steve Jobs

Goodbye Steve Jobs. You are missed and you are loved. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be programming on Windows. You convinced me I deserved better. Thank You!

You were right; I did deserve better. I deserve a mature command line. I deserve to work with beautiful software. I deserve a brushed aluminum unibody frame. I deserve LED backlights and a lit keyboard. I deserve a trackpad that is awesome! I deserve eight hours of battery life. 

I'm a better software developer and a better product designer because of you Steve Jobs. Thank You! You taught me to focus on quality, beauty and simplicity. Thank You!

Our World is a better place because you were in it:

{% highlight ruby %}
def eulogy
  #Rubyists miss you
  puts "Goodbye Steve Jobs."
end
{% endhighlight %}

A piece of you lives on in each of us:

{% highlight ruby %}
var eulogy = new (function() {
  var mourn = function() {
    //Even ninjas miss you
    console.log("Goodbye Steve Jobs.");
  };

  return {
    farewell: mourn
  };
})();

eulogy.farewell();
{% endhighlight %}

Rest in peace Steve Jobs. May fate love you in the next life as much as she loved you in this. Say hello to Biggie and Tupac for me.
