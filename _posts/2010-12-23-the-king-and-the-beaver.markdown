Vimeo is a great service for Creatives to share their work with the world! Every piece I've engaged with always stirs me with the passion and the dedication of the people who make each video happen. Here is one such example:

*Le Royaume* (The king and the Beaver), Student graduating film 2010 at Gobelins, L'ecole de l'image.

Written, directed and animated by Nuno Alves Rodrigues, Oussama Bouacheria, Julien Chheng, Sebastien Hary, Aymeric Kevin, Ulysse Malassagne & Franck Monier.
Music by Mathieu Alvado.
