That's the paradox: the only time most people feel alive is when they're suffering, when something overwhelms their ordinary, careful armour, and the naked child is flung out onto the world. That's why the things that are worst to undergo are best to remember.

But when that child gets buried away under their adaptive and protective shells - he becomes one of the walking dead, a monster. So when you realize you've gone a few weeks and haven't felt that awful struggle of your childish self - struggling to lift itself out of its inadequacy and incompetence - you'll know you've gone some weeks without meeting new challenge, and without growing, and that youâ€™ve gone some weeks towards losing touch with yourself.

The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn't live boldly enough, that they didn't invest enough heart, didn't love enough. Nothing else really counts at all.
