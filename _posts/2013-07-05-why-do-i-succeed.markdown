Why do I succeed?

I succeed because I am willing to do the things you are not.

I will fight against the odds.

I will sacrifice.

I am not shackled by fear, insecurity or doubt.

I am motivated by accomplishment, not pride.

Pride consumes the weak...kills their heart from within.

If I fall, I will get up.

If I am beaten, I will return.

I will never stop getting better.

I will never give up...ever.

That is why I succeed.
