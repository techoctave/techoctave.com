Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others - past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.

Something amazing happens when developers come together. You could call it camaraderie. You could even call it kinship:

I call it amazing.

[Columbus Code Camp][1] 2012 is right around the corner. This year we're featuring some of Central Ohio's most talented designers and developers. People who endure. People who inspire. People who love the craft from pixel to production.

[Register for Columbus Code Camp][2] and join the fun. We'll have raffles, good food and excellent presentations.

Are you on a team that ships software? Do you live to code? Ready to take the next step? [Give a talk and change the world][3].

See you there!
