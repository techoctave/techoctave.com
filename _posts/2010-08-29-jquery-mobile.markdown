###And in this corner...

jQuery Mobile is an ambitious project which aims to provide developers with a JavaScript framework for some [seriously cross-platform & cross-device][1] development. Developers will have access to a jQuery core as well as a user interface suite of components via jQuery UI.

It looks like this framework will be able to handle everything from the Apple iPad to the Palm Pre. From the website:

> jQuery UI foundation. -jquerymobile.com

###A Step in the Right Direction

Fundamentally, I think this is a step in the right direction. Thanks to the Apple iPhone, mobile development is definitely more enticing these days. But, for years it was marred by inconsistency and dis-unification.

Couple the inconsistency with the fly-by-night quality of the majority of mobile devices and a second-thought distribution network and you had a development environment that didn't encourage innovation.

Why develop for a platform that is the *hottest item this Summer* to find out its been replaced by a *new shiny thingamajig just in time for Christmas*?

For now, I think I'll still advise clients to set their sights on building native apps for the Apple line of mobile devices: iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. The staying power (consistency), sex appeal and distribution network make the Apple platform ideal for developers.

###Write less. Do more. 

Yet, I still think jQuery Mobile framework must be nurtured as its promise is far too compelling. Think about it:

{% highlight html %}
 - Your next app could be consumed without direct approval by the mobile provider
 
 - Write once, Run everywhere
 
 - No $100/yr or fees per sale structures
 
 - Software-as-a-Service business model for Mobile devices
{% endhighlight %}

I predict native apps will continue to dominate the market for the time being. However, the business case for jQuery Mobile is truly compelling. With a release date of late 2010, you can bet I'm definitely looking forward to its beta release.
