If you're in the business of generating sales, you (no doubt) have used white papers, how-tos and other devices to generate leads and qualify clients. How do you track the ratio between downloads and leads generated?

Knowing that number gives you keen insight into the value of that white paper and how-to. That's where a solution like [Entourage.js][1] comes to the rescue in tracking the download part of the equation. Knowing the number of downloads could help you refine your white paper, increase downloads and consequently, increase qualified leads.
