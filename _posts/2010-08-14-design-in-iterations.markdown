The power of search has consumed us all. What we need, what we are looking for, is always a search away. Yep, that's the world we live in; a world where information is now always at our fingertips, a world where access to information is as routine as brushing your teeth.

Since searching has become such an iconic part of our lives, why not embrace the experience of designing a search box on your next web app or blog?

Here's a quick glimpse into my experience designing the search box for [Seventh Octave][1]. 

###Initial Concept
This was the original concept. I really thought that it was a good starting point. But, I decided it could use a little rework.

###Rework Concept 
Here's my second concept. You can see that I altered a few things. I made the link text more succinct to give it a cleaner look. I also, decided to emphasize the search box area; so I removed the search box button on the right, expanded the search box area and added some depth to it by creating a drop shadow on the top and left corner.

###Final Concept
For a final touch, I added the magnifying glass to symbolize the purpose for the box (to search of course.) ... And Whoalah! My search box is now complete.

So, when you do begin designing your search box, don't forget to make it a [fun experience][5]. After all, your search box is the beginning to an enjoyable search experience for your visitors.
