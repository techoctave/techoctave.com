If you haven't heard by now, [Google Voice][2] is about to shakeup the telecom market and take over the world. Well, maybe not the world. But, if you're like me, you're wondering:

> Do I have to stay logged into Gmail to
> use Google Voice? Cause that would just suck. -Actual Developer's Brain

Well my friend, the answer is a resounding No! Here are your Google Voice Desktop Client options. The short and sweet version:

### Google Voice Desktop Clients

#### Mac
Mac users, check out this [Mac OSX Google Voice Desktop Client][3]. This Mac OSX Google Voice client is a Universal binary, so it should work with PPC and Intel based Macs.

#### Windows
Windows users, check out this [Windows Google Voice Desktop Client][4] rolled on the Adobe AIR framework for your Windows XP to Windows Vista using pleasure.

### Google Voice for Mobile
Think about it, combine Google Voice with the iPhone and you have a killer recipe for a Mobile Google Voice Client.

This setup probably wouldn't get you much when making local and domestic calls. But, [Google Voice can save money when making an International call][6] when compared to making that same International call with Skype. 

A setup like this could also work for geeks that like having a VOIP solution to play with, but don't want to be tied to a computer. For you iPod Touch users, don't forget to grab a Blue Tooth Headset or Apple Earbuds. iPad users, you have a built in microphone and speakers, so you're good-to-go!

### Google Chrome Extension for Google Voice
You might not have thought about it, but as far as desktop clients go, the [Google Chrome Extension for Google Voice][7] is a pretty good option.

Think about it. Google Chrome runs on Windows and Mac, so the client experience should be universal once you upgrade to a real development machine.

The only thing is you'll have to get used to keeping your chrome browser open continuously. But, if you mainly develop on Firefox, you can use Chrome for other things like running a Google Voice Client.

The service looks great so far. Cultures of growth have high innovation and high competition, so I think Google Voice is a great disruptive force for the often stagnant telecommunications market.

Well, get out there and give it a shot and be sure to let me know your thoughts on the service.
