# Galileo FAQs

## Why do I need a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret?

With your own Consumer Key and Consumer Secret you can safeguard your Twitter account from the activity of other users as well as ensure adherence to [Twitter's Rules and Best Practices](https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/114-guidelines-best-practices/articles/69214-rules-and-best-practices). Using your own keys also ensures you get to take full advantage of Twitter Search, Following and Unfollowing.


## Do I have to enter the keys each time I use Galileo?
