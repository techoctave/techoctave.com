So now you can design your gauges to look just like you imagined. Here's what's included in the package:

<ul class="list features">
	<li>Scalable width and height</li>
	<li>Major and minor ticks</li>
	<li>Green, yellow and red</li>

	<li>Over 70+ customizable properties</li>
	<li>Over 30+ sample gauges to jumpstart your project</li>
	<li>License</li>
</ul>

Flexibility is the hallmark of our Dashboard Gauge Suite. Our gauges are built to give you a foundation for your imagination. With over 70+ customizable properties, the sky is literally the limit with our gauges.

<br/>

## Stunning photorealistic gauges.

<strong>A little something extra - should you ever need it.</strong> Ever competed for a bid and it came down to who could impress the client most? We've been there too and know a little extra flair can mean the difference between deal or no deal:

![stunning_photorealistic_gauges](/images/stunning_photorealistic_gauges.png)

Go all digital or use our photorealistic textures (included with purchase). You can even use your own custom textures with our easy-to-use configuration properties. All the flexibility of our digital gauges with the timelessness of your favorite roadster:

![powerful_javascript_gauges_library](/images/powerful_javascript_gauges_library.png)

Our gauge library is highly-configurable, so mix and match features to create something truly unique and all your own. Make the purchase. Our gauges are great for executive dashboards, simulations or simply to impress your hard won clientele.

<br/>


## Cross browser goodness baked in.

<strong>Cross browser and cross platform.</strong> We believe in standards-based development and we believe you can get there without Flash or any other proprietary platform.

That's why we use standards-based SVG, VML and JavaScript. No Flash means longer battery life. No Flash means our gauges are mobile friendly - Think iPad & iPhone. We built a JavaScript gauge library we love to use and you will too.

![browsers](/images/browsers.png)

We've tested on both Windows and Mac OS X in every major browser. Including: IE7 and IE8, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and even Opera. You focus on coding your business logic. We've got you covered in the browser department.

<br/>

## Beautiful and Usable Documentation

<strong>Software that's easy to use.</strong> Software shouldn't be painful to handle. In fact, the information you need to get going should be well organized and easily understood:

![documentation](/images/documentation.png)

We produce quality documentation of how our software works, insuring you spend most of your time enjoying our JavaScript gauges and being most productive on your projects.

<br/>


## So what's under the hood?

<strong>Everything a sophisticated developer needs.</strong> Beautiful object oriented code. You already know JavaScript, so implementation is a breeze. You will find JavaScript and jQuery best practices with an easily extensible Gauge class and smart default options. Check this out:

<p class="code">
	<span>var sales = new Gauge("sales", {</span>
		<span class="content">label: "Sales",</span>
		<span class="content">minValue: 0,</span>
		<span class="content">maxValue: 100,</span>
		<span class="content">majorTicks: 11,</span>
		<span class="content">minorTicks: 4</span>
	<span>});</span>
</p>

Is it really that easy? Yes it is my friend. Yes it is.

Most of the time you'll need to feed data to your gauge from a remote server. Let's say you want to get the latest [JSON data](https://rawgit.com/techoctave/data/master/data.json) from your server:

<p class="code">
	<span>$.getJSON(url, function(response) {</span>
		<span class="content">var units = response.data.sales;</span>
        
		<span class="content">sales.setValue(units);</span>
	<span>});</span>
</p>

Here, we used jQuery to make an Ajax call for some JSON data. What this means is you can update each gauge without refreshing the page. You'll be able to do this with every gauge in our suite. Think of the possibilities!

<strong>Smart and intuitive API design.</strong> Each purchase includes sample projects with tons of examples on how to use our gauge's API. This includes a live example of how to feed data to our gauges from a remote server using Ajax.

For an advanced discussion on client-side polling techniques, see [Long Polling with JavaScript and jQuery](https://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery) on the TechOctave blog. There we discuss various options for feeding data to our gauges from a remote server.

<br/>

## So, what's next exactly?

<strong>Purchase a library package.</strong> Within a few seconds, you'll receive a receipt for your purchase and a secure link to download the package. Each package comes with tons of examples to get you up and running in no time.

Or contact us to schedule a demo. We'll walk you through the example projects and answer any questions you may have.
